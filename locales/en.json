Since there are no taller buildings nearby, the view opens up widely and helps broaden the mind and thoughts.\n\nAs mentioned in the Tower Tour section, the climb can be a bit challenging, with steep and narrow stairs. For many sport-loving visitors, this is part of the fun. After climbing ten floors, blood circulation improves, which helps sharpen the senses. This makes the wide view even more enjoyable.

It was cast in 1606 by Bartholomeus Wengle in Augsburg. The other six bells were cast in 1947 by Czudnochowsky in Erding.

    "story1Title": "Why elasticity matters",
    "story1Text": "Due to a renovation mistake in the past, the wooden bell frame (Glockenstuhl) was removed and replaced with a concrete frame. This resulted in a lack of elasticity, which is essential for the movement of the bells.Bells are heavy, and their swinging transfers force into the tower. A wooden bell frame provides elasticity and reduces stress on masonry. When rigid materials such as concrete are used, they cannot absorb the vibration adequately, making cracks in the tower walls more likely.",
    "story1Caption": "Elastic wooden frames absorb motion, reducing stress on masonry.",

    "story2Title": "Reconstruction (1950–1951)",
    "story2Text": "After several years of vibration and structural deterioration, another renovation took place. The upper part of the tower (which was most affected by vibration) was dismantled and rebuilt. The wooden Glockenstuhl was restored instead of concrete to ensure elasticity. This is a clear example of how wood can be superior to rigid materials under certain conditions.",
    "story2Caption": "The tower was dismantled and rebuilt to restore safety and harmony.",
    "noteTitle": "The relic discovery",
"noteP1": "During the reconstruction of the tower in 1950, workers discovered a sealed metal box hidden inside the structure. The box, dated 1784, contained a relic of an unknown martyr, handwritten blessings, and prayers asking for protection of the church and the city.",
"noteP2": "After reconstruction, the contents were returned to the tower together with contemporary documents from 1950, continuing a long-standing tradition of safeguarding the church through faith and memory.",

    "title": "Baselbalg (the Bellow)",

    "intro": "St. Nikolaus Church houses a large and powerful pipe organ, whose sound depends entirely on a continuous and precisely regulated supply of air. This air is produced by the Baselbalg (bellows), a traditional wooden mechanism that forms the silent foundation of the organ’s voice.\n\nUnlike modern electric systems, the Baselbalg works through carefully engineered layers of wood that rise and fall slowly, storing and releasing air at a constant pressure. This gentle, rhythmic motion ensures that each pipe speaks evenly, preserving both pitch stability and tonal warmth.\n\nVisible during the tower tour, the Baselbalg offers a rare insight into historic organ craftsmanship, reminding visitors that the grandeur of the organ’s sound is made possible by a quiet, almost invisible system working continuously in the background.",

    "s2Text": "The system is almost entirely made of wood and consists of four stacked layers. These layers move slowly and quietly, rising and falling to generate the airflow required for the organ pipes. This gentle mechanical movement helps preserve the organ’s traditional sound quality.",

    "s3Text": "St. Nikolaus Church regularly hosts organ concerts. The music is performed by an experienced musical ensemble of around 20 musicians and singers led by Mr. Christopher Ryser. The repertoire includes classical works (especially J. S. Bach), choral compositions from the 16th and 17th centuries, and contemporary sacred music. An organ concert takes place every Saturday at 12:00 noon. Everyone is welcome, admission is free, and donations are encouraged and appreciated.",

    "s4Title": "4) Makers and craftsmanship",
    "s4Text": "The large and impressive organ was built by the company Reil from the Netherlands and installed in the church on December 6, 2009 (St. Nicholas Day). Since then, its sound has become an integral part of the church’s liturgy. The chest organ in the chancel was built by the German company Linder from Nußdorf am Inn.",

    "quoteTitle": "A quiet system with a powerful effect",

    "quoteLead": "Matthew 7:13",
    "quoteText": "The old cast iron door reminds us of the Biblical phrase “enter through the narrow gate”. The attic’s entry feels narrow, then suddenly opens into a wider space. That contrast makes the experience a rewarding one.",

    "section1Title": "1) Structure and craftsmanship",
    "section1Text1": "The attic is defined by its timber geometry: beams, joints, and frames that carry the roof are all made from wood, without using much metal. Even when the space is mostly empty, the structure itself becomes the main exhibit. The smell of wood, the silence, and the wide space together create a unique feeling.",
    "section1Text2": "According to the organizer, wood was chosen not only for aesthetics, but also for practical strength-to-weight performance and durability across centuries.\n\nThe attic also appears to be a place where a peaceful pause can be made after already climbing several floors. A little rest while walking through the place makes one prepared for the upcoming events.",
    "section1Cap1": "Angled frames and long sightlines make the attic feel larger and spacious.",
    "section1Cap2": "One can already see the beautiful town from the windows of the attic.",

    "section2Title": "2) The entry and “narrow gate” feeling",
    "section2Text1": "The entry point is an old iron door set into thick stone. Its proportions and material hint at medieval building methods - compact, defensive, and built for endurance.",
    "section2Text2": "After passing the narrow entry, the space opens. This immediate expansion creates a strong contrast of “compression and release” in how visitors experience the place.",
    "section2Cap" : "The old entry door from 1300s: a small threshold that changes how you perceive the space beyond it.",

    "section3Title": "3) Inscriptions and small artifacts",
    "section3Text1": "There is a special stone plate with historical German writing (known as Frühneuhochdeutsch). The stone plate describes the chronological history of the church and the tower. It reminds us of the older time when writing special texts on stone plates was a respectable practice. Even without reading every line, the typography and material presence communicate age and seriousness.",

    "section4Text1": "There are two falcons who live in the church (one nest in the attic, another nest is even above, near the clock). The organizers made considerable efforts to make the birds feel welcome and at home. Careful window design and nesting arrangements ensure free movement of the birds while keeping the building safe, especially in the wet season.",
